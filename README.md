# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm AwesomeYoungCoder, a teenage developer who likes cubing, maths (Yes, you read it right!) and is TOTALLY obsessed with Harry Potter.
I work mainly on Python and Scratch, but nevertheless I'm also working on web development - that is, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
My hobbies are to write, read, cube, play around with Lego, listen to music, solve tough and mind-boggling riddles, as well as play the piano.
I'm corrently working on PyEncrypter, a Python encryption and decryption library, as well as my Official Scratch homepage.
